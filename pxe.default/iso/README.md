### What is this folder for?

Can put here your downloaded ISO files, for booting windows installer, ubuntu installer, etc

This folder you should put:

* ISO files, downloaded from the internet. For each of your boot CDs.
* See each `filename__PUT_HERE__.txt` is just a placeholder.
* You need to get hold of the real .ISOs for windows, and ubuntu


DONT FORGET:

MUST ALSO need to mount each of these ISO file to its own unique samba share. So that the root folder of the mounted ISO disk image is the root folder of that samba share.

The other docker image `dreamcat4/samba-iso` can be used for that.
